# Python-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Recreation
To use this script,
You first have to install Python(the programming language) and visual studio code(the code editor) [I'm to lazy to add links, as of writing this
in my country it's currently like half 2 in the morning] 
Then when you open the code in visual studio, click run and then run without debugging, 
 then type either odd or strategy-based to choose difficulty (odd means the opponent makes random decisions and strategy-based uses extra factors influencing
 the opponent's decisions)
 and then consistently type rock, paper or scissors
 to stop running the code just click run and then stop running
 
# Version-1.4-Notices:
A bug was fixed where it was almost impossible for the strategy bot to use scissors


A bug was fixed where the probabilities were mostly even (that was not intended)
