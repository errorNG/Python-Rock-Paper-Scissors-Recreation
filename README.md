# Python-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Recreation
To use this script,
You first have to install Python(the programming language) and visual studio code(the code editor) [I'm to lazy to add links, as of writing this
in my country it's currently like half 2 in the morning] 
Then when you open the code in visual studio, click run and then run without debugging, 
the text in the terminal should explain the rest but to stop running the code just click run and then stop running
